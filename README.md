# CS6400-Thesis-on-COVID-19-detection-based-on-Chest-X-ray-images

## Problem Statement:
***Radiographic Chest X-ray analysis is found to be the most accurate method to precisely diagnose the COVID-19 infected patients. But the detection requires medical supervision, and it is difficult for the health care to handle diagnosis of large number of test samples. Therefore, to handle the huge test samples and diagnose quickly, machine learning/ artificial intelligence techniques could be used to handle the analysis.***

## Dataset Information:
***The dataset is taken from Kaggle maintained by Qatar university and Tampere university researchers [QaTa-COV19 Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/aysendegerli/qatacov19-dataset). It has 4,603 COVID-19 infected Chest X-ray images. The database also has 2,951 ground-truth segmentation mask images of the corresponding image dataset of the CoV-19 CXR dataset.*** 

## Methodology:
***The research around the given CXR dataset would involve the above-explained architectures to get efficient segmented images. The architecture could be stand-alone architecture or a hybrid form of architectures. The segmented image is then put into a time-series network to predict the illness severity. Figure below is a proposal for the thesis to generate a segmented image from a CXR image.***
